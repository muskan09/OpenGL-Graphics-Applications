# OpenGL-Graphics-Applications
Drawing Algorithms implemented in C++ using OpenGL. Each directory can be downloaded as a fully functional Visual Studio solution. GLEW and GLFW are used for OpenGL implementation.

## Details:
1. OpenGL: Implementation of 3 line drawing algorithms: Simple DDA, Symmetric DDA and Bresenham.
2. OpenGL_1: A fully fledged graphics application, with implementations of Bresenham's line and circle drawing algorithms. Edit options include functionalities for changing shape thickness, style, color of shape and it's endpoints, as well as deletion of shape; in addition to options for changing window properties.
3. OpenGL_2: Major changes in UI done to move from console based text input to mouse input. Color filling algorithms added.
